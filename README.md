# TTColorPicker
Repo made for learning purposes.

This repo should help me to learn Java ana JavaFX and to document my progress.
Idea is to copy functionality of ColorPic app (http://www.iconico.com/colorpic/) which is great anyway.

Goals and desription:
App is divided into five sections: Palettes, Chips, Color, Mixer and Magnify.
