# TTColorPicker
Repo made for learning purposes.

This repo should help me to learn Java and JavaFX and to document my progress.
Goal is to copy functionality of ColorPic app (http://www.iconico.com/colorpic/) which is great anyway.

Description:
App is divided into five sections: Palettes, Chips, Color, Mixer and Magnify.
- Palettes are sets of <= 16 colors. You can create, edit names and delete them.
- Chips are colors in those Palettes.
- Color is simply chosen color, with hex and dec representation.
- Mixer is used for chosing color in a different ways (hex, rainbow, hue, sliders).
- Magnify is for picking color from screen.
